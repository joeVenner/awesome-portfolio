Live Demo [lafrimi.me](https://www.lafrimi.me) built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and hosted with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

This website's design is both simple and accessible. Dynamic particles create an experience that is interactive and visually inviting. The site offers two themes via a toggle, dark mode (default) and light mode. Once toggled, the selected theme should persist between tabs, windows, and page reloads.
